[NOTE] This manual page is copy/pasted from Linux as calling "pwd --help" from the CWUSHELL
is not possible for this command specifically, all other commands do not have an issue.

pwd: pwd [-LP]
    Print the name of the current working directory.

    Options:
      -L        print the value of $PWD if it names the current working
                directory
      -P        print the physical directory, without any symbolic links

    By default, `pwd' behaves as if `-L' were specified.

    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 unless an invalid option is given or the current directory
    cannot be read.
